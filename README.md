**** What is a Webhook in SonarQube? ****

A webhook in SonarQube is a way for the SonarQube server to notify external systems (like CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, or messaging services) when specific events occur in a project, such as:

When an analysis is finished.

When a Quality Gate status changes (e.g., Passed, Failed).

When a new issue is raised or an existing issue is updated.

In essence, a webhook allows SonarQube to send a payload (data) to an external URL (such as a listener or a service) whenever certain events happen within SonarQube.
